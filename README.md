Hi! This is the source code for [my homepage](https://mylesb.ca/ "Myles Braithwaite"). It uses the Node.js static web site generator [Assemble](http://assemble.io/) and a bunch of other Grunt tasks (see the [package.json](package.json) for more information).

## Usage

You will need to have Node.js, NPM, and Grunt installed to work on this website.

### `grunt build`

This command will build the web site.

### `grunt develop`

This command will build and run a simple web server for viewing the web site locally.

### `grunt deploy`

This command will build, compress, and deploy the web site.
